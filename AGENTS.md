# Agent repository guidance

## Org Plan supervised workflow invariants

- Treat the loaded Org Plan skill directory and exact supplied plan path as
  supervision inputs. Reuse them; do not search with `find` or `rg`, assume a
  repository-local `.gestalt/`, inspect helper source, or probe help before the
  first lifecycle command. Do not run `prepare-supervision` during ordinary supervised execution:
  it is setup-only and `gestalt-setup.sh` owns profile
  installation. If the helper or plan input is absent, report that single
  prerequisite instead of trying speculative paths.
- The depth-zero root combines director, reviewer, and supervisor duties in the
  user's initial Codex conversation. Its recommended read-only
  `org-plan-reviewer` launch profile defaults to Sol; an already-running root
  keeps its CLI-selected model. The root directly launches exactly one fresh
  depth-one `org-plan-executor` per L1. The executor defaults to Terra, is the
  only code writer, and reports only to the root. Do not create an intermediate
  supervisor or a separate reviewer.
- Every L1 must have exactly one non-empty `:SKILLS:` property and exactly one
  `:REVIEW_STATUS:` property, initially `UNREVIEWED`; L2s must have neither.
  `:SKILLS:` is a whitespace-separated list of exact `$skill` references chosen
  by comparing the L1 with the complete available skill catalog. Do not list
  `$gestalt:context-mode`; every role loads it as a mandatory baseline.
  Each fresh L1 executor loads that baseline plus exactly the declared
  task-specific list before repository inspection or implementation and stops
  without edits if either is unavailable.
  `REVIEWED` is valid only after reviewer acceptance of a DONE L1. Reopening a
  reviewed L1 as WIP resets it to `UNREVIEWED`; reset a completed reviewed L1
  explicitly before any material correction that does not reopen it.
- Use `org-plan next PLAN review` to select the first DONE + UNREVIEWED L1,
  `org-plan review PLAN ID REVIEWED|UNREVIEWED` for durable transitions, and
  `org-plan describe PLAN ID` for stable title plus Goal/Why text and L1 Skills.
  The reviewer
  skips already REVIEWED milestones, so appended refinement L1s do not trigger
  repeat audits of accepted work.
- After every successful `authoring-start`, `supervision-start`, `set`, `l2`,
  `review`, or external `resync`, the active root runs `org-plan projection PLAN`
  and calls host `update_plan` with its exact ordered plan items, while
  reporting the companion explanation separately. This is a
  best-effort UI projection only: a missing or failed host tool warns once,
  never changes or rolls back Org state, and is retried at the next lifecycle
  boundary. Executors report mutations; Bash and MCP code never invoke another
  Codex tool.
- Keep one writer active. The read-only root delegates implementation and
  corrective edits only to the active executor. Executor evidence and review
  requests go directly to the root as concise structured summaries.
- Treat supervision as a completion loop, not a report relay. The executor owns
  its whole assigned L1, not one L2, and continues across L2 completion,
  checkpoints, tests, and progress updates until the L1 reaches its review
  boundary. After every executor report, inspect the executor's current state.
  If its L1 is partial and the executor stopped or became idle, resume that same
  executor immediately. Otherwise take the next eligible lifecycle action:
  review only a DONE + UNREVIEWED L1, finish an accepted L1, or launch the next
  L1. Never turn a partial report into a final user response or wait for
  progress approval. Stop only after the complete plan is accepted or when a
  genuine external blocker remains that the root cannot resolve without user
  input or changed external state.
- Org Plan files are workspace-local runtime coordination data and are never
  Git deliverables. No user request, repository instruction, or release
  workflow can permit staging, committing, force-adding, cherry-picking, or
  otherwise introducing an Org Plan into Git history. Before every accepted L1
  commit, the executor and root inspect `git diff --cached --name-only` and
  reject the commit if it contains the active plan or any `.gestalt/*.org` path.
- Run potentially large inspections, tests, and log processing through an
  available context-preserving execution path. If none is available, capture
  output outside conversational context and report only the command, exit
  status, pass/fail counts, affected scope, and smallest necessary failure
  excerpt. Short fixed-output observations may remain direct. Load the installed
  `$gestalt:context-mode` skill in every role, but do not install or enable
  it automatically when unavailable.
- Keep the root active and post brief human-facing status at supervision start
  and when an L1 starts, reaches review, is rejected, is accepted, or blocks.
  Use `L1 POSITION/TOTAL — TITLE: STATUS` when possible. Resolve the first
  milestone mention with `org-plan describe` and lead with its position, title,
  and Goal/Why; later mentions may use the position and title alone. Lead the
  first commit mention with its conventional subject and purpose; IDs and hashes
  are supplemental. Machine assignments retain exact IDs and commit ranges.
- Routine L1 review is an agent-to-agent gate: the root independently inspects
  the executor's evidence and returns ACCEPT or REJECT directly to that
  executor. Do not ask the user for progress decisions or review approval;
  request user input only for material ambiguity or an unavailable prerequisite.
- Final acceptance requires the root to verify a current full-suite pass
  and clean intended scope. It does not repeat reviewer audits for REVIEWED L1s.

## Optional human-attention protocol

`gestalt_org_plan_attention` is an optional mobile dynamic tool, not an
`$org-plan` dependency. Its schema version is 1. After exhausting safe
in-scope checks, roots and executors call it before yielding only for a genuine
table-qualified blocker: a material plan change (`planChange`/`planRevision`),
exhausted hard block (`hardBlock`/`externalStateChanged`), unavailable required
dependency (`missingDependency`/`dependencyInstalled`), missing authority
(`permissionRequired`/`permissionGranted`), changed external state
(`externalState`/`externalStateChanged`), or unresolved material ambiguity
(`materialAmbiguity`/`userGuidance`). Every call includes a bounded summary and
a concrete requested action. If the tool is absent, report the ordinary blocker
without treating it as a missing Org Plan dependency.

A mobile autopilot checkpoint is synthetic control input: it never changes plan
scope or review authority. On a checkpoint, either emit the table-qualified
attention call or immediately resume the next legal Org Plan lifecycle action.
Never escalate progress, child reports, waiting on a live child, review
readiness, recoverable test failures, ordinary merge conflicts, token/context
pressure, elapsed time, checkpoints, or executor idleness.

## Vendoring skills for Codex and `npx skills`

Keep one canonical copy under
`plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/<skill-name>/`. Codex loads that tree through
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json` with `"skills": "./skills/"`; the marketplace entry
points to `./plugins/<plugin-name>`, producing
`<plugin-name>@dyne-gestalt-agents`.

The `skills` CLI recursively discovers `SKILL.md` files when no standard
top-level skill container is present. The same nested directories therefore
appear individually in `npx skills add dyne/gestalt-agents --list`. Do not add a
duplicate root `skills/` tree or repository symlinks: copies drift, while
symlink behavior differs across installers and operating systems.

Vendor complete directories, including references, scripts, examples, assets,
agent metadata, executable modes, and relative paths. Record the upstream
repository, release, commit, and license. Exact vendors use a committed SHA-256
manifest for relative paths, regular-file types, executable modes, and contents;
reject symlinks in the vendored tree.

If project coherence requires instruction changes, treat the package as an
attributed downstream adaptation rather than an exact vendor. Record every
rename, omission, and behavioral change in the plugin's `UPSTREAM.md`; use a
distinct downstream packaging version; and make the checksum fixture describe
the adapted package state. On update, import a new pinned upstream version,
reapply and reassess the documented adaptations, then regenerate the fixture.

Verify plugin manifests, marketplace metadata, checksums, `SKILL.md`
frontmatter, `agents/openai.yaml`, individual `npx skills` discovery, the full
test suite, and `git diff --check`.

Run `npx skills` discovery against a clean temporary copy of distributable
plugin content, excluding ignored references and development fixtures. Strip
terminal control sequences, parse discovered skill names, and assert the exact
expected set with each name appearing once; substring checks against the raw
CLI output can pass on descriptions or unrelated checkout content.

Equivalent skills from two enabled plugins can both trigger. Keep installation
explicit and document conflicts; a plugin must not silently install or disable
another plugin.
