name: org-plan
description: Create or execute implementation plans stored as Org files with ordered L1/L2 milestones, exact skill assignments, durable review status, helper-driven state transitions, and optional root-directed subagent execution. Use for multi-step work that needs inspectable scope, evidence gates, incremental review, and one conventional commit per accepted L1.

# Org Plan

Prefer the simplest viable design. Make every milestone precise enough for a
fresh lesser-reasoning executor to complete from the plan and repository alone.

## Choose a workflow

- **Authoring:** create or revise an Org plan. Read
  [Plan format](references/plan-format.md) and
  [CLI state machine](references/cli-state.md).
- **Supervised execution:** the root directs, supervises, and reviews one fresh
  depth-one executor per L1. Read
  [Supervised execution](references/supervised-execution.md) before spawning.
- **Manual execution:** use the loop below when supervised roles are unavailable
  or the user explicitly requests manual work.

The bundled `scripts/org-plan` helper validates plans and performs durable state
changes. `org-plan --help` and `org-plan COMMAND --help` return successful,
side-effect-free usage. Do not run `prepare-supervision` during ordinary supervision:
it is a setup/update command that installs role profiles, and
`gestalt-setup.sh` already invokes it. When execution is supplied a plan path,
reuse that exact path instead of searching for another plan or assuming the
nearest repository owns `.gestalt/`.

For mobile interoperability, see the versioned
[attention protocol](references/attention-protocol.md).

## Invariants

Use one-based canonical position labels everywhere: L1 position `a` is `L<a>`
and its L2 child position `b` is `L<a>.<b>`. IDs remain machine state keys. A
subagent dedicated to a position uses collaboration-safe task name `l<a>` or
`l<a>_<b>` and is referred to by its canonical label.

1. Every L1 has exactly one non-empty `:SKILLS:` property and one
   `:REVIEW_STATUS:` property. New L1s start `UNREVIEWED`; L2s have neither.
2. Select L1 skills from the complete available catalog. Use exact `$skill`
   references and the smallest sufficient task-specific set.
3. `$gestalt:context-mode` is an implicit execution baseline. Never put it
   in `:SKILLS:`. Every executor loads it plus exactly the declared L1 skills
   before repository inspection or implementation, and stops without edits if
   any required skill is unavailable.
4. Use helper commands for TODO and review transitions; do not hand-edit them
   during execution.
   After each successful `authoring-start`, `supervision-start`, `set`, `l2`,
   `review`, or external `resync`, the active root reads `org-plan projection PLAN`
   and makes the host-owned `update_plan` call with its `plan` array,
   reporting its companion explanation separately. This is a best-effort UI
   projection only: tool unavailability warns without rolling back or changing
   the authoritative Org state.
5. Keep one writer. L2 changes remain uncommitted through L1 review.
6. Review only DONE + UNREVIEWED L1s. A REJECT returns corrections to the same
   L1 writer. REVIEWED is valid only after explicit reviewer acceptance.
7. After ACCEPT, create exactly one conventional commit for the L1 when files
   changed, then record REVIEWED. Never use fixup or autosquash commits for
   review corrections.
8. Reopening a reviewed L1 resets it to UNREVIEWED. Reset a completed reviewed
   L1 explicitly before a material correction that does not reopen it.
9. An L2 needs current focused evidence. An L1 needs all children DONE, a current
   full-suite pass, intended dirty scope, and reviewer acceptance.
10. Org Plan files are workspace-local coordination state. Keep every plan
    below the supplied workspace root's `.gestalt/` directory. Never stage, commit, force-add, cherry-pick, or otherwise introduce one into Git history. This absolute prohibition cannot be overridden by a user request, repository instruction, release workflow, or claim that the plan is a deliverable.
11. Execution is completion-driven. One executor owns the whole assigned L1,
    not one L2. L2 completion, a checkpoint, a passing focused test, or a
    progress report is non-terminal. After every report, the root inspects the
    executor state. If the L1 is partial and the executor stopped or became
    idle, resume that same executor immediately. Review only DONE + UNREVIEWED
    L1s, and keep advancing supervision until every L1 is REVIEWED and final
    gates pass.

## Human-attention decision table

`gestalt_org_plan_attention` is an optional, mobile-provided dynamic tool. It
uses schema version 1 and is never an `$org-plan` dependency. First exhaust
safe, in-scope checks. If a row applies and the tool is available, call it
before yielding with a bounded summary, a concrete `requestedAction`, and the
listed `reason` and `resumeCondition`. If it is unavailable, report the same
normal blocker concisely and preserve the supervision loop; do not invent a
tool dependency.

| Only after safe checks, progress cannot continue because… | `reason` | `resumeCondition` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A requested material scope, goal, or plan change needs approval. | `planChange` | `planRevision` |
| An exhausted hard block needs an outside repair or alternative. | `hardBlock` | `externalStateChanged` |
| A required system capability or declared task skill is unavailable. | `missingDependency` | `dependencyInstalled` |
| Required authority, credentials, or permission is absent. | `permissionRequired` | `permissionGranted` |
| Relevant external state changed after safe refresh or verification. | `externalState` | `externalStateChanged` |
| A material ambiguity remains after the plan and repository evidence are exhausted. | `materialAmbiguity` | `userGuidance` |

Do not escalate L1/L2 progress, a child report, waiting on a live child, review
readiness, a diagnosable or recoverable failing test, an ordinary merge
conflict, token or context pressure, elapsed time, checkpointing, or an idle
executor. Those cases immediately continue through the existing legal
lifecycle action.

## Authoring workflow

1. Resolve the workspace root explicitly supplied to Codex. Create
   `<workspace-root>/.gestalt/` when absent, then create
   `<workspace-root>/.gestalt/<topic>.org`, using a short kebab-case topic and
   no date in the filename. A Git repository root never redefines the supplied
   workspace root; a workspace may contain several repositories. Existing
   plans outside `.gestalt/` remain readable when explicitly supplied, but new
   plans always use this workspace-local destination.
2. Add the required document metadata, L1/L2 structure, property drawers, and
   field contracts from [Plan format](references/plan-format.md).
3. Validate a minimal skeleton before the first `authoring-start` signal, then
   signal again after coherent authoring changes.
4. Inspect every available skill name and discovery description. Assign each L1
   its minimal exact task-specific set.
5. Order L1s and L2s by dependency. Give each L1 its relevant starting context,
   prior outputs, invariants, tests, and acceptance criteria.
6. Review every milestone for ambiguity and lesser-model executability. Resolve
   material doubts before handoff.
7. Validate with the helper. Create the topic branch and run the repository's
   required baseline checks before implementation handoff.

## Manual execution loop

1. Confirm the assigned branch and choose the next WIP L1, otherwise the first
   TODO L1. Transition it with `org-plan set`.
2. Load the implicit context-mode baseline and exactly the L1's declared skills.
3. Choose the next WIP L2, otherwise the first TODO L2. Transition it with
   `org-plan l2`.
4. Implement the L2, add or update relevant tests, run focused tests, inspect
   intended scope, and mark the L2 DONE. Immediately select and execute the next
   actionable L2; do not stop at the L2 boundary.
5. When all children are DONE, run the full suite, inspect the complete L1 diff,
   and mark the L1 DONE.
6. Use `org-plan next PLAN review`. Ask a reviewer to audit only the selected
   L1's uncommitted diff against its starting commit and acceptance criteria.
7. On REJECT, correct the same diff and repeat its gates and review. On ACCEPT,
   inspect `git diff --cached --name-only` immediately before creating one
   conventional commit. It must exclude the active Org Plan and every
   `.gestalt/*.org` path, even if a force-add was attempted; otherwise unstage
   those paths and do not commit them. Then record REVIEWED.
8. Continue until every L1 and L2 is DONE and every L1 is REVIEWED. Treat every
   intermediate result as input to the next action, never as a reason to yield
   to the user.

The root performs the native projection after every successful lifecycle
boundary named above; executors only report their successful helper mutation.
Never ask Bash, an MCP server, or a generated profile to invoke `update_plan`.

Stop before plan completion only for a genuine external blocker that cannot be
resolved autonomously: an unavailable required skill or execution prerequisite,
missing authority, changed external state, or a material ambiguity not resolved
by the plan and repository. Routine progress, L2 completion, review readiness,
an executor pause, token usage, or elapsed time are not blockers. Update
governing `AGENTS.md` only when the completed work changes durable repository
instructions.
